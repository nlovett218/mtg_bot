# MTG_Bot

Magic the Gathering bot has been revived and finally with a better name!

This is a simple text-based version of the popular card game Magic the Gathering. This bot provides a simple and fun experience for the casual player, whether you have or haven't played Magic the Gathering before. The premise is simple, collect as many cards as you and use them to your advantage to control the battlefield, whether they be creature cards or sorcery cards. You can begin your journey by typing m!begin and you can get help at any time by typing m!help.

THIS BOT IS STILL IN DEVELOPMENT! Some features will not work as intended, as I continue to work on the bot.
